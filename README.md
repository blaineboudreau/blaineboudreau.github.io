Approach:
I used constructor functions to build cards and shuffled deck. 
Next, I made player, dealer, and bank objects.
player and dealer objects contained methods for hitting, staying, finding hands value, checking for bust, and reseting.
bank object contained methods wining, pushing, and making bet responsive to bets.
DOM manipulation consited of calling on methods according to logical gameplay, event listeners for buttons, if/else if statments for winning conditons and alert messages

installation instructions:
type bet in input box at bottom and click bet button
then click hit button until satisfied with hand or bust
click stay to initiate dealer
repeat process

unsolved problems:
getting dealer values to display before resetting
did not leave time to incorporate card images or style well
